# Animal Crossing NL: Planner
This is the PC version of the Animal Crossing: NL Planner app.  
It can be used with the Nintendo 3DS game Animal Crossing: New Leaf, mainly to keep track of meetings with villagers, what fish you caught, creating a TPC, etc. 

## Features
- Visual TPC
A TPC with the current profile information such as mayor name, town name, FC, DC and image. You can also save it as a jpg.

- Automatic Villager Birthday Notice
Checks your set profile to see if any of your villagers have a birthday on the day and adds a notice for you.

- Profile Management
Create town profiles that you can use, edit and delete.

- Notice Board
Make notices for meetings with villagers, events etc.

- Collectible Checklist
Keep track of what you’ve caught and what you need to catch, where and when.

- Themes and Accents
Awesome backgrounds from here and here. Also a settings section where you can change the colour of the application.

- Villager and Collectible XML Database
Holds all villager names, personalities, species, birthdays and icons so that you can easily select villagers when creating a profile. The bug/fish/seafood ones hold information such as name, type, info, image(if connected to the internet), and can be found on the Checklist tab.

- User Settings
If you change the theme, turn off the sound, use a profile or add notices, it all saves and is still there when you start it up again.
